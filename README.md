   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

The repository includes a command-line interface (CLI) for running automation tasks. Here are some examples of how to use the CLI:

### Display Version

To display the version of the CLI tool, run:
```bash
python cli.py --version
```

### Run a Specific Task

### API Client Example

The `api_client.py` module provides a simple interface for making API requests. Here's an example of how to use it:

```python
from api_client import APIClient

# Initialize the API client with the base URL and API key
client = APIClient(base_url="https://api.example.com", api_key="your_api_key")

# Make a GET request to the "status" endpoint
response = client.get("status")

# Print the response
print(response)
```
### Data Processor Example

The `data_processor.py` module provides functionality for data cleaning and transformation. Here's an example of how to use it:

```python
import pandas as pd
from data_processor import DataProcessor

# Create a sample DataFrame
sample_data = pd.DataFrame({'col1': [1, 2, None, 4], 'col2': ['A', 'B', 'B', None]})

# Initialize the DataProcessor
processor = DataProcessor()

# Clean the data
cleaned_data = processor.clean_data(sample_data)

# Print the cleaned data
print(cleaned_data)
```
### Report Generator Example

The `report_generator.py` module allows for generating structured reports. Here's an example of how to use it:

```python
from report_generator import ReportGenerator

# Initialize the ReportGenerator with a title
report = ReportGenerator(title="Automation Report")

# Add a section to the report
report.add_section(heading="Introduction", content="This is a sample report section.")

# Save the report to a PDF file
report.save_report(filename="example_report.pdf")
```

To run a specific task, use the `-t` or `--task` option:
```bash
python cli.py -t example
```

Replace `example` with the name of the task you want to run.
